    <div class="b">The Prevalence Of Mental Health Issues Among Teenagers<P>

    </P></div>
    <div class="c">Many adolescents experience positive mental health, but an estimated 49.5 percent of adolescents has had a mental health disorder at
        some point in their lives For young people who do have mental health disorders, early intervention and treatment can help them reduce the impact on their lives.
       <br><br>
       It is a normal part of development for teens to experience a wide range of emotions. It is typical, for instance, for teens to feel 
       anxious about school or friendships, or to experience a period of depression following the death of a close friend or family member.
        However, mental health disorders are characterized by persistent symptoms that affect how a young person feels, thinks, and acts. 
       Mental health disorders also can interfere with regular activities and daily functioning, such as relationships, schoolwork, sleeping,
        and eating.</div>
